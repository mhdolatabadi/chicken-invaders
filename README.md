# Chicken Invaders
Chicken Invaders is an implementation of the popular game with the same name using javafx.
## How to install
The only way I know yet, Is to clone the code and run the main method of ChickenInvaders class. Some ways like exporting as a jar binary file, failed for some reason in javafx.
## How to play!
You can play using arrow keys for movement and space for shot. Note that you can't shot by pressing space for a long time, instead, you must release the space to shot be completed.
